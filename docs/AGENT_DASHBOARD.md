# Agent Dashboard (canonical UI)

## What this is

**`agent-dashboard/`** is the **only** supported source for the `/dashboard/agent` experience: the Explorer-style shell, Monaco, and agent column. It replaces the older IAM-only React bundle.

## What it is not

- **Not** “MeauxCAD” or “AITestSuite” as product names. Those are legacy repo or Worker labels. In docs and scripts, say **Agent Dashboard**.
- **`agent-dashboard-legacy/`** holds the **previous** IAM Vite app (`main.jsx`, `AgentDashboard.jsx`, single-file `agent-dashboard.js` output) for reference or emergency rollback. **Do not** use it for new sandbox or production deploys unless you explicitly roll back.

## Git

- **`agent-dashboard/`** is a **submodule** pointing at `https://github.com/SamPrimeaux/meauxcad.git` until that remote is renamed. The **path in this monorepo** is always **`agent-dashboard/`**.

## Build and deploy

- Build: `cd agent-dashboard && npm ci --include=dev && npm run build` (use `--include=dev` when `NODE_ENV=production` so `vite` is installed).
- Deploy scripts inject `<!-- dashboard-v:N -->` before `</html>` in `dist/index.html` for version checks (`grep dashboard-v` on `/dashboard/agent`).
- Output (submodule workspace): `agent-dashboard/agent-dashboard/dist/` (including `assets/` chunks). Sandbox: `./scripts/deploy-sandbox.sh` uploads **all** files under that `dist/` to R2 key prefix `static/dashboard/agent/` and uploads `dist/index.html` as **`static/dashboard/agent.html`** (what the worker serves for `/dashboard/agent`).
- Worker: `worker.js` resolves `/static/dashboard/agent/assets/...` to keys under the Vite `dist/` layout.

## Workers

- **Sandbox dashboard:** `inneranimal-dashboard` — `wrangler.jsonc`, `assets.directory` = `agent-dashboard/agent-dashboard/dist` (monorepo path; Vite app is the nested npm workspace package).
- **Lab worker** historically named `aitestsuite` is separate; do not confuse with the **Agent Dashboard** app source in this repo.
